The need for a database of g-functions would not have been realized by
the developer(s) without the Department of Energy contract 
DE-AC05-00OR22725, via a subcontract from Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory. Computation of the database g-functions was made possible
by the Oklahoma State University High Performance Computing Center. 
Development of the g-function calculation tool, cpgfunction, was 
supported via the OG&E Energy Technology Chair.
