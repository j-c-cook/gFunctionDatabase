abstract = {This paper introduces a new methodology for the generation of thermal response factors of geothermal bore fields using the concept of g-functions introduced by Eskilson. Boreholes are divided into segments to consider the variation of the heat extraction rates along the length of the boreholes and the analytical finite line source (FLS) solution is used to calculate the temperature variations at the wall of each borehole segment along the axial direction. The proposed methodology accounts for the time variation of the heat extraction rates among boreholes and along the length of individual boreholes to obtain a uniform borehole wall temperature equal for all boreholes in accordance with the original boundary conditions proposed by Eskilson. In addition, the methodology is generalized to account for boreholes of different lengths and buried depths. g-Functions calculated with the proposed methodology are compared to the numerical technique used by Eskilson to derive the g-functions for fields of 1 to 12×12 boreholes. The difference between the two models is within 5% for all studied bore fields, except for fields of boreholes located on a single row. The variation of the heat extraction rates of individual boreholes along their length as well as in time also showed good agreement with the numerical model. It is shown that using 12 borehole segments is adequate to calculate the g-functions in most practical cases. For instance, the error on the g-function of a 10×10 bore field calculated using 12 borehole segments is 2.2% after 20years and 4.7% at steady-state.},

abstract = {Numerical methods are proposed for the efficient evaluation of the g-functions of geothermal bore fields using the finite line source solution. The presented methods reduce the calculation time for the calculation of g-functions by reducing the number of numerical evaluations of the analytical finite line source solution. A similarity identification method is presented to identify pairs of boreholes for which the finite line source solution takes the same value. A load history reconstruction method is presented to evaluate the g-function at non-uniform time-steps. Using the proposed numerical methods, the calculation time for the g-function of a rectangular field of 12 × 12 boreholes is reduced by a factor 308. The numerical methods allow the evaluation of g-functions of bore fields with large amounts of boreholes in irregular configurations. The g-function of a field of 512 randomly positioned boreholes is calculated in 27 minutes.},

abstract = {This paper presents an enhanced vertical ground heat exchanger (GHE) model for whole-building energy simulation (WBES). WBES programs generally have computational constraints that affect the development and implementation of component simulation sub-models. WBES programs require models that execute quickly and efficiently due to how the programs are utilized by design engineers. WBES programs also require models to be formulated so their performance can be determined from boundary conditions set by upstream components and environmental conditions. The GHE model developed during this work utilizes an existing response factor model and extends its capabilities to accurately and robustly simulate at timesteps that are shorter than the GHE transit time. This was accomplished by developing a simplified dynamic borehole model and then exercising that model to generate exiting fluid temperature response factors. This approach blends numerical and analytical modeling methods. The existing response factor models are then extended to incorporate the exiting fluid temperature response factor to provide a better estimate of the GHE exiting fluid temperature at short simulation timesteps.},

abstractNote = {During the last ten years, several design tools were developed for ground loop heat exchangers. One such tool is the GLHEPro, used for commercial building loop heat exchangers. The simulation of the temperature response of the ground loop heat exchanger to monthly heating and cooling loads and monthly peak heating and cooling demands over several years forms the basis for the design methodology. Meeting the minimum and maximum heat pump entering fluid temperatures specifications set by the user is effected by automatically adjusting the ground loop heat exchanger size. The temperature response predictions comprises three steps. In the first step, the building heating and cooling loads are translated to heat extraction and heat rejection rates using a simple heat pump model. In the second step, a detailed conduction heat transfer simulation, developed by Eskilson forms the basis for the long term temperature response of a ground loop heat exchanger to heat rejection and extraction. Thirdly, a simple analytical approximation for the response of the ground loop heat exchanger to a single peak heat extraction or rejection pulse is used for the short term temperature response of the ground loop heat exchanger. To further illustrate the technical aspects underlying the program, an example of a ground loop heat exchanger for a 27,000 square foot office building in Ottawa, Ontario is discussed. 9 refs., 12 figs.},
