abstract = {This paper introduces a new methodology for the generation of thermal response factors of geothermal bore fields using the concept of g-functions introduced by Eskilson. Boreholes are divided into segments to consider the variation of the heat extraction rates along the length of the boreholes and the analytical finite line source (FLS) solution is used to calculate the temperature variations at the wall of each borehole segment along the axial direction. The proposed methodology accounts for the time variation of the heat extraction rates among boreholes and along the length of individual boreholes to obtain a uniform borehole wall temperature equal for all boreholes in accordance with the original boundary conditions proposed by Eskilson. In addition, the methodology is generalized to account for boreholes of different lengths and buried depths. g-Functions calculated with the proposed methodology are compared to the numerical technique used by Eskilson to derive the g-functions for fields of 1 to 12×12 boreholes. The difference between the two models is within 5% for all studied bore fields, except for fields of boreholes located on a single row. The variation of the heat extraction rates of individual boreholes along their length as well as in time also showed good agreement with the numerical model. It is shown that using 12 borehole segments is adequate to calculate the g-functions in most practical cases. For instance, the error on the g-function of a 10×10 bore field calculated using 12 borehole segments is 2.2% after 20years and 4.7% at steady-state.},

abstract = {•g-Functions are calculated from the finite line source analytical solution.•The variation of the fluid temperature inside the boreholes is considered.•g-Functions are calculated for a range of borehole thermal resistances, internal thermal resistances and fluid flow rates.•The value of the g-function is shown to be dependent on the non-dimensional borehole thermal resistance.
A model to calculate g-functions accounting for the axial variation of borehole wall temperatures and heat extraction rates due to thermal interaction between the fluid and the borehole wall is presented. Boreholes are divided into segments, with each borehole segment modeled as a finite line source. Borehole wall temperatures are calculated from the spatial and temporal superposition of the finite line source solution. A delta-circuit of thermal resistances is used to consider the heat transfer between the fluid and the borehole wall. A system of equations is built in the Laplace domain and solved for an equal inlet fluid temperature for all boreholes in the bore field. The values of the g-function tend toward the g-function obtained using a uniform heat extraction rate boundary condition as the borehole thermal resistance increases and tend toward the g-function obtained using a uniform temperature boundary condition as the borehole thermal resistance decreases. It is shown that modeling the thermal interaction between the fluid and the borehole wall is required to accurately predict the g-function.},

A linear system of first order differential equations is built based on a steady-state thermal resistances approach to the heat transfer between the U-tube pipes and the borehole wall. Analytical expressions for fluid temperature profiles are provided for boreholes with arbitrary borehole wall temperature profiles as well as piece-wise uniform and uniform borehole wall temperature for different U-tube configurations: independent, parallel and series. The analytical model is coupled to a finite line source model of the heat transfer between the borehole and the ground. Fluid and borehole wall temperature profiles are solved simultaneously using numerical Laplace transforms to consider the time variation of the temperatures and heat extraction rates. Results are verified against a finite difference model of the borehole. Differences between the fluid temperatures calculated with the numerical and analytical models are smaller than 0.003 °C.

Using the proposed numerical methods, the calculation time for the g-function of a rectangular field of 12 × 12 boreholes is reduced by a factor 308.

The fluid temperature, from minutes to decades, is determined using step response functions. An analytical radial solution is used for shorter times. A finite line-source solution is used for longer times. The line-source response function has been reduced to one integral only.

abstract = {This work presents a validation of two common methods for designing vertical ground heat exchangers. Both a simulation-based design tool and the ASHRAE handbook design equation are used to find design lengths for four different real systems, using actual experimental data, including building loads as well as physical parameters as inputs. The measured minimum and maximum ground heat exchanger exiting fluid temperatures were used as the design constraint. The simulation-based design tool predicted the borehole length to within 6% in all cases, while the ASHRAE handbook design equation yielded systems with errors from -21% to 167%. Most of this error can be explained by the way loads are represented in the ASHRAE handbook equation, with differences in the borehole thermal resistance also playing a smaller part. The ASHRAE handbook equation relies on a very simple load representation; although this allows it to be used as a simple hand calculation, it also precludes it achieving acceptable accuracy. It does not appear to be possible to revise the ASHRAE handbook equation so as to both significantly improve its accuracy and allow its use in a simple hand calculation.},

abstract = {This paper presents an enhanced vertical ground heat exchanger (GHE) model for whole-building energy simulation (WBES). WBES programs generally have computational constraints that affect the development and implementation of component simulation sub-models. WBES programs require models that execute quickly and efficiently due to how the programs are utilized by design engineers. WBES programs also require models to be formulated so their performance can be determined from boundary conditions set by upstream components and environmental conditions. The GHE model developed during this work utilizes an existing response factor model and extends its capabilities to accurately and robustly simulate at timesteps that are shorter than the GHE transit time. This was accomplished by developing a simplified dynamic borehole model and then exercising that model to generate exiting fluid temperature response factors. This approach blends numerical and analytical modeling methods. The existing response factor models are then extended to incorporate the exiting fluid temperature response factor to provide a better estimate of the GHE exiting fluid temperature at short simulation timesteps.},

abstractNote = {During the last ten years, several design tools were developed for ground loop heat exchangers. One such tool is the GLHEPro, used for commercial building loop heat exchangers. The simulation of the temperature response of the ground loop heat exchanger to monthly heating and cooling loads and monthly peak heating and cooling demands over several years forms the basis for the design methodology. Meeting the minimum and maximum heat pump entering fluid temperatures specifications set by the user is effected by automatically adjusting the ground loop heat exchanger size. The temperature response predictions comprises three steps. In the first step, the building heating and cooling loads are translated to heat extraction and heat rejection rates using a simple heat pump model. In the second step, a detailed conduction heat transfer simulation, developed by Eskilson forms the basis for the long term temperature response of a ground loop heat exchanger to heat rejection and extraction. Thirdly, a simple analytical approximation for the response of the ground loop heat exchanger to a single peak heat extraction or rejection pulse is used for the short term temperature response of the ground loop heat exchanger. To further illustrate the technical aspects underlying the program, an example of a ground loop heat exchanger for a 27,000 square foot office building in Ottawa, Ontario is discussed. 9 refs., 12 figs.},
